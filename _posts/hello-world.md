# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog / portfolio site. I'm a software engineer by day, but in my
spare time I like to run away from the web side of thing and write Rust for
computer graphics and computer vision projects. Outside of writing code, I try
to spend as much time as I can outdoors. After years of knowing I'd love cycling
I finally acquired a real bike and I've fallen deeply in love with cycling, be
it on the road, gravel, and now mountain biking. I'm an avid photographer and I
was once the photo editor of my universities newspaper. I've been a fan of
Tottenham Hotspur since 2008, and some day I'll get across the pond to see a
match, but still yet to happen. I've recently just learned to sail and the next
step is to start crewing for some boats at the local yacht club and also to
acquire a small dinghy to single hand and really hone my skills there.

Writing a blog isn't exactly something I thought I'd do, but I've spent a summer
learning new things and I'd like to continue this trend into the fall as my
hobbies tend to be a little more... summer focused. That being said, it's often
really easy to prove you're an expert in a language you use for work and not
quite as easy to prove for languages you use on the side and I hope to use this
to make it a bit more clear and also to document the things I've learned for
others.

Anyways, if you also love to discuss new ideas in tech, building solutions for
those problems, and have similar outdoor hobbies please get in touch!
