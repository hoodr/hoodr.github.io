I'm a software engineer by day, but in my\nspare time I like to run away from the web side of thing and write Rust for\ncomputer graphics and computer vision projects. Outside of writing code, I try\nto spend as much time as I can outdoors. After years of knowing I'd love cycling\nI finally acquired a real bike and I've fallen deeply in love with cycling, be\nit on the road, gravel, and now mountain biking. I'm an avid photographer and I\nwas once the photo editor of my universities newspaper. I've been a fan of\nTottenham Hotspur since 2008, and some day I'll get across the pond to see a\nmatch, but still yet to happen. I've recently just learned to sail and the next\nstep is to start crewing for some boats at the local yacht club and also to\nacquire a small dinghy to single hand and really hone my skills there.\n\nWriting a blog isn't exactly something I thought I'd do, but I've spent a summer\nlearning new things and I'd like to continue this trend into the fall as my\nhobbies tend to be a little more... summer focused. That being said, it's often\nreally easy to prove you're an expert in a language you use for work and not\nquite as easy to prove for languages you use on the side and I hope to use this\nto make it a bit more clear and also to document the things I've learned for\nothers.\n\nAnyways, if you also love to discuss new ideas in tech, building solutions for\nthose problems, and have similar outdoor hobbies please get in touch!\n\n- [email](mailto:drewhoo.8@gmail.com)\n- [Github](https://github.com/hoodr/)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewhoo/)\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/hello-world/cover.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/hello-world/IMG_1638.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
