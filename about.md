Hey, I'm Drew!
permalink: about
Thanks for visiting! Hopefully I'll have a much cleaner fully working site up and running soon, but such is the life of a college student. In the meantime, find me on [Flickr] or even better find me on [The Heights].

More about me, I'm a Math and C.S. major at Boston College. This is my portfolio for my images as well as some cool stuff I'm working on / thoughts that sometimes compell me to write words about (in the rare occurences that happens). For now, you can find some code on Github here: {% include icon-github.html username="hoodr" %}
